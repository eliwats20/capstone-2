I'm Eliyah,
an aspiring programmer!

I'm a 20-year-old Korean-American computer science major from Camp Springs, Maryland.
I'm currently enrolled in Hood College in Frederick, Maryland and am in my third year.
I have been coding since I was 12-years-old because I found excitement in programming.
I have worked with languages such as Java, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and I am looking forward to learning JavaScript!

More About Me!

I love listening to music like Hip-Hop, R&B, Rock, Soul, Neo-Soul, and more.
I enjoy working out occasionally, but I might have to get back on schedule!
I love to watch television, movies, and mostly YouTube videos.
